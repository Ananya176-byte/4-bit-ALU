PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project successfully demonstrates a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using NI Multisim, designed to execute fundamental arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU employs a multiplexer-based control mechanism to dynamically select operations based on input control signals. The computed results are processed and displayed using a 7-segment display, ensuring clear visualization of outputs.

FEATURES:

✅ Performs the following operations:
- Addition (A + B)
- Subtraction (A - B)
- Logical AND (A & B)
- Logical OR (A | B)
- Logical XOR (A ⊕ B)
  
✅ Mode control for arithmetic operations (Addition/Subtraction)

✅ Uses 4-bit inputs (Ai,Bi) with individual bit-wise processing

✅ 4-to-1 Multiplexer-based operation selection

✅ 7-segment display to show results
